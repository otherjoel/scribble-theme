Custom CSS themes for Scribble documentation

## What is this?

A Racket package that makes it easy to publish [Scribble] documentation with
custom CSS styling, while keeping the default Racket docs styling for local
builds and official documentation sites.

**Documentation is at <https://joeldueck.com/what-about/scribble-theme>.**

When you write documentation with `#lang scribble/manual`, it looks great with
the default CSS. But if you want to publish to your own website with custom
styling, you need to replace the default CSS files. This package provides
a simple way to do that without modifying your original Scribble source files.
